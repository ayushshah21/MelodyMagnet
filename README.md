## Notes

Some challenges I faced:

- Scraping the correct song data from the Apple Music Playlists so that each song is accurate and reflects the song in the user's playlist
- Keeping all of the songs together in a zip file: I was originally sending back each song one by one which would be very inconvenient for the users to maintain and store on their devices
